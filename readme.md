# RyanairJs

## Functionalities
 - Typescript classes for each Ryanair "object" (like a Route, a Fare, a City, an Airport...)
 - Load and browse all airports, regions, countries, cities served by Ryanair (I call that RyanairGeoPlace), with full all informations
 - Can look for any flights from a RyanairGeoPlace to an other RyanairGeoPlace, on any date interval
 - Agregate RyanairGeoPlace together
 - Search airports nearby
